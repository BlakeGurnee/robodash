Robodash provides multiple functionalities for different types of users:

If you would like to learn more about Robodash's suite of built-in widgets, such
as the autonomous selector, see the [widgets guide](./guides/usage/widgets.md).

If you want to integrate your own LVGL GUIs with Robodash, see the
[views guide](./guides/views.md).
